"""Hold a bimanual pose under sustained load and log per-servo telemetry.

A2 phase 3 (sustained actuator load).

The pose is captured by hand ONCE and saved to --pose-file. Every later run
replays that saved pose, so all loads in a sweep share one geometry -- without
that, the moment arm changes between runs and deflection is not comparable
across loads. Only the right gripper is left free each run, so the operator can
wrap it around the weight while the rest of the pose stays fixed.

Feetech STS3215 servos report their own internal temperature, current, load and
voltage over the bus, which is what this logs. That is the servo's own sensor
measured against the 70 C limit the firmware protects against, rather than a
housing surface temperature.

Usage:
    python diagnostics/hold_pose_thermal.py --minutes 45 --out results/A2/actuator_load/run_1

While running, type annotations and press ENTER:
    bat 87        battery state of charge, percent
    seat 41.2     external probe reading, degrees C
    note ...      free text

Ctrl-C stops early and releases torque. Torque is ALWAYS released on exit.
